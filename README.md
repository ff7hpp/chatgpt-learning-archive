ðŸ§  ChatGPT Learning Archive

This repository documents my personal learning journey with the help of ChatGPT.

The structure is organized by **year**, and each year is split into **4 parts** (quarters).  
Each part includes **3 months**, and every month contains **4 weeks**.  
Each week has its own `.md` file where I write what I learned, key notes, and reflections.
